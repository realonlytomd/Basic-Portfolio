					<p>Funny story: Before choosing his major at UT-Austin, Tom had seen "The Empire Strikes Back" at the theater the night before.  As he looked over the choices of his major for the next 4 years, he made it as far alphabetically as Aerospace Engineering, and thought, "That sounds cool!"</p>
					
					<p>After graduation, finding a job, and then working in that field at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Tom decided to "retire" and give writing a try.  He paid the bills by getting a license in Massage Therapy and working for himself, and at a high-end training gym.
					
					<p>Twenty-five years later, with about the same amount of forethought as he gave choosing a major in college, Tom has decided to go on to a third (fourth?) profession - full stack developer!
